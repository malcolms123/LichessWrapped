### LICHESS WRAPPED (INCOMPLETE)

## PURPOSE
I want to make a wrapped for lichess. Similar to spotify wrapped and chess.com wrapped. Could be a fun thing to see different stats on how I played chess this year. Also would've liked to see friends' wrapped and share w the community.

## STATUS
The project is currently incomplete. I have worked through processing the pgn file you get from lichess as well as some brainstorm on the potential info I would like to show. I was working on figuring out the best text to display for openings but ran into the issue of ECO opening encoding being too specific and not using the terminology I would like (eg. it says I play a variety of specific queens pawn openings but would like it to just be I play the London). I am undecided on distribution of this, not sure if it makes sense to package it as anything more than a python script but could be cool to display as a webpage, I think I need to learn more to do this well. There is also rate limiting on downloading games so it would need to load for a long time regardless. It is Dec 29, I don't think I have the time this year to finish this but could revisit next year.
